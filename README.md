"Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency."

It's a tool used to track and organize code changes, typically across a team of people, that makes it easy to work on multiple parts simultaneously.

**Git** - is a command line application (with optional GUI) that runs on your local computer. It tracks the changes you make to project files, stores and organizes your changes across local branches, and bundles your changes so they can be shared (push-ed) and retrieved (pull-ed) from a server (repository).

**GitHub** - cloud service and accompanying website that hosts code repositories so others can view and share them. Handles authorization for who can view/edit the code. Free for individuals, even private repositories, but advanced collaboration features are paid, public repos get a lot of advanced features free.
